# Stargazing Wallpapers - Meteor Shower

Welcome to our collection of stunning stargazing wallpapers! Our meteor shower wallpaper captures the magic of a clear night sky, with bright streaks of light crossing the darkness. Whether you're an astronomy enthusiast or simply love the beauty of the cosmos, this wallpaper is sure to inspire wonder and awe.

## About Meteor Showers

Meteor showers occur when the Earth passes through a trail of debris left by a comet or asteroid. As these tiny particles enter the Earth's atmosphere, they burn up, creating bright streaks of light that we call "shooting stars." While individual meteors can be seen on any clear night, meteor showers offer a chance to see dozens or even hundreds of shooting stars in a single night.

Some of the most well-known meteor showers include:

-   Perseids (August)
-   Geminids (December)
-   Leonids (November)

To see a meteor shower, find a dark location away from city lights and give your eyes time to adjust to the darkness. Bring a blanket or chair to sit on and enjoy the show!
