## About Deep Sea Creatures
The deep sea is home to many fascinating creatures, some of which have yet to be discovered by humans. These creatures have adapted to survive in the extreme conditions of the deep ocean, including high pressure, darkness, and cold temperatures. Bioluminescence, like that seen in the wallpaper, is a common adaptation that allows creatures to communicate, attract prey, or deter predators in the dark depths.
