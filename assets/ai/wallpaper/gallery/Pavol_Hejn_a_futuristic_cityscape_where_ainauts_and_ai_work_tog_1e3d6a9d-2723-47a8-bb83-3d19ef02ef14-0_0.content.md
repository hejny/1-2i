## Our Mission
Our mission is to inspire and empower people to take action towards a more sustainable future. We do this by providing resources, information, and tools to help individuals and communities make a positive impact on the world around them.

#### Green Infrastructure
> "Green infrastructure is a cost-effective, resilient approach to managing wet weather impacts that provides many community benefits. While single-purpose gray stormwater infrastructure—conventional piped drainage and water treatment systems—is designed to move urban stormwater away from the built environment, green infrastructure reduces and treats stormwater at its source while delivering environmental, social, and economic benefits." - [EPA](#green-infrastructure)

Some examples of green infrastructure include:
- Green roofs
- Rain gardens
- Permeable pavement
- Bioswales
