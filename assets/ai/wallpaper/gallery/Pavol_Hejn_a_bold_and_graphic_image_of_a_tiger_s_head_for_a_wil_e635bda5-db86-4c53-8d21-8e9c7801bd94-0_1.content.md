# Tiger Conservation: Protecting the Majestic Big Cats

Welcome to our website dedicated to tiger conservation! Our mission is to raise awareness about the plight of these majestic big cats and to promote their protection in the wild. As a symbol of this mission, we have chosen a bold and graphic image of a tiger's head as our wallpaper.

## About Tigers

Tigers are one of the most iconic animals in the world. They are the largest members of the cat family and are known for their distinctive orange coats with black stripes. Unfortunately, tigers are also one of the most endangered species on the planet. According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), there are only around 3,900 wild tigers left in the world.

## Threats to Tigers

The main threats to tigers are habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. As human populations grow and expand into tiger habitats, the big cats are forced to compete for resources and often come into conflict with people. In addition, tigers are hunted for their skins, bones, and other body parts, which are used in traditional medicine and as status symbols.

## Our Work

At Tiger Conservation, we are committed to protecting tigers and their habitats. We work with local communities, governments, and other organizations to promote sustainable development and reduce human-tiger conflict. We also support anti-poaching efforts and work to raise awareness about the importance of tiger conservation.

If you share our passion for tiger conservation, there are many ways to get involved. You can:

- Make a donation to support our work
- Volunteer with a local wildlife organization
