## What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is a type of machine learning model inspired by the structure of the human brain. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes that process information and make predictions based on patterns in the data.

## Why Use a Neural Network?

Neural networks are powerful tools for solving complex problems in a variety of fields, including image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. They can learn from large amounts of data and make accurate predictions even in situations where traditional algorithms struggle.
