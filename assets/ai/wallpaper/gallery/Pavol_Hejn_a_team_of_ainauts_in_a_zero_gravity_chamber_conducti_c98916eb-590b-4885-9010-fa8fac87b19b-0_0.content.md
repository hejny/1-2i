# AI and Human Body Experiments in Zero-G

Welcome to our website showcasing the groundbreaking work of our team of Ainautes. We conduct experiments on the effects of artificial intelligence (AI) on the human body in a zero-gravity chamber.

Our team is dedicated to advancing our understanding of how AI interacts with the human body, and we believe that studying these effects in a zero-gravity environment can provide unique insights into this complex relationship.

Explore our website to learn more about our research, meet our team of experts, and discover the latest news and updates from our zero-gravity lab. Thank you for visiting!
