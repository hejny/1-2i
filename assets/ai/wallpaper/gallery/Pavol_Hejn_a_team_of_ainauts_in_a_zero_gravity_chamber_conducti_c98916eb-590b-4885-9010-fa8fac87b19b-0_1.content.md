# AI's impact on space health

Welcome to our website dedicated to exploring the effects of artificial intelligence on the human body in zero gravity. Our team of Ainautes is conducting experiments in a zero-gravity chamber to better understand how AI can impact human health.

## About Us
Our team consists of experts in various fields, including AI, space exploration, and medicine. We are passionate about understanding how AI can be used to improve human health and well-being.

## Our Research
In our zero-gravity chamber, we are conducting experiments to study the effects of AI on the human body. We are exploring topics such as:

- How AI can be used to monitor and diagnose health issues in space
- The impact of AI on human sleep patterns in zero gravity
- How AI can be used to enhance physical and mental performance in space

Our research has the potential to benefit not only astronauts but also people on Earth who may face similar health challenges.

## User Stories
We have interviewed astronauts and other individuals who have spent extended periods in space to better understand their experiences with health issues. Their stories have helped us develop our research questions and inform our experiments.
