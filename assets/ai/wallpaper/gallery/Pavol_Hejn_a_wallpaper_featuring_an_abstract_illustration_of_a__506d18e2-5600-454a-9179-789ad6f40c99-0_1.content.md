# Futuristic Cityscape Background for Your Tech Website

Welcome to our tech website, where we provide you with the latest news and updates on technology. Our website is all about staying ahead of the game and embracing the future. To help set the tone for our content, we've chosen a stunning wallpaper featuring an abstract illustration of a futuristic cityscape.

## The Wallpaper

Our background features a dark and moody color scheme, with glowing lights that give the impression of a bustling metropolis. The cityscape itself is abstract, with towering buildings and structures that seem to stretch endlessly into the sky. The gradient background adds depth and dimension to the overall design, making it perfect for any tech-related website.
