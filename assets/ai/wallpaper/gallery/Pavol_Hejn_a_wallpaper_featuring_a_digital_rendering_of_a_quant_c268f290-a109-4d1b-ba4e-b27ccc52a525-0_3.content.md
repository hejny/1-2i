## About Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we solve complex problems. Unlike classical computers, which use bits to represent information as either 0 or 1, quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.
