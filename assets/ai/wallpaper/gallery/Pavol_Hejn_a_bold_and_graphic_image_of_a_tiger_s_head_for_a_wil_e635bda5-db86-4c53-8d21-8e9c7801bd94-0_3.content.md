# Save the Wild: Protecting Endangered Species

Welcome to Save the Wild, a website dedicated to raising awareness and supporting animal conservation efforts. Our mission is to protect endangered species and their habitats from destruction and exploitation.

## Our Wallpaper

Our bold and graphic wallpaper features the majestic head of a tiger, one of the world's most iconic and endangered animals. Tigers are threatened by habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. By using this image on our website, we hope to draw attention to the urgent need for conservation action.

## About Us

Save the Wild was founded by a group of passionate wildlife enthusiasts who wanted to make a difference in the fight against extinction. We believe that every individual can play a role in protecting the planet's biodiversity, and we work to empower people with knowledge and resources to take action.

## Our Projects

We support a variety of conservation projects around the world, from protecting sea turtles in Costa Rica to restoring forests in Indonesia. Our initiatives focus on preserving critical habitats, combating illegal wildlife trade, and promoting sustainable development.
