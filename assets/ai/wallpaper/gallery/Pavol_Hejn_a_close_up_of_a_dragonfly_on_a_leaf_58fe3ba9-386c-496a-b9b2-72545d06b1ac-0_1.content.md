## User Stories

"I was struggling to find a way to make my home office feel less sterile and more inviting. That's when I discovered these nature-inspired backgrounds. I chose the dragonfly design, and it's made such a difference. Now, when I'm working, I feel like I'm surrounded by nature, even though I'm inside." - Lisa, marketing manager

"I've always loved the outdoors, but I live in a city and don't get to spend as much time in nature as I'd like. Using a nature-inspired background has been a great way to bring a little bit of the outdoors into my home office. The dragonfly background is my favorite - it's so detailed and realistic." - Tom, software developer
