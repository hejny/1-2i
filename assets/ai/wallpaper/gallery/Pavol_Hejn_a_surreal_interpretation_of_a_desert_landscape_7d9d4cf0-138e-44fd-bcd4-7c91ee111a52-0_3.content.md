### Surrealism - Tate

> "Surrealism aimed to revolutionise human experience, rejecting a rational vision of life in favour of one that asserted the value of the unconscious and dreams." - Tate

Surrealism was an artistic and literary movement that emerged in the early 20th century. Its practitioners sought to explore the unconscious mind and tap into the power of dreams to create works that were both strange and beautiful.

### What is Surrealism? - MoMA

> "Surrealism is a cultural movement that began in the early 1920s, and is best known for its visual artworks and writings. The aim was to 'resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality.'" - MoMA

Surrealism was a response to the horrors of World War I and the societal upheaval that followed. Its artists sought to break free from traditional modes of representation and create works that challenged viewers' perceptions of reality.
