## About Meteor Showers

Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through debris left behind by comets or asteroids. As these objects enter Earth's atmosphere, they burn up and create bright streaks of light across the sky. Some meteor showers are more intense than others, with hundreds or even thousands of meteors visible per hour.
