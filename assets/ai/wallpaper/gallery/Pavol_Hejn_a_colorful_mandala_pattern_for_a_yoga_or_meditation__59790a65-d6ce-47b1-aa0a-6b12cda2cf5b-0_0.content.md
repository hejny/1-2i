## What is Mandala Meditation?

Mandala meditation is a form of meditation that involves focusing on a mandala, which is a circular design with symmetrical patterns. The practice of mandala meditation has been used for centuries in various cultures as a way to promote relaxation, reduce stress, and increase focus and concentration.

To practice mandala meditation, simply find a quiet and comfortable place where you can sit undisturbed for a period of time. Then, choose a mandala that resonates with you and focus your attention on it. Allow your mind to become absorbed in the design, letting go of any thoughts or distractions that arise.

As you continue to focus on the mandala, you may notice that your breathing becomes slower and more rhythmic. You may also feel a sense of calm and relaxation wash over you. This is the power of mandala meditation at work.
