# Black Hole Wallpaper

Welcome to our website featuring a stunning digital image of a black hole! This wallpaper showcases the distorted shapes and bright colors that represent the extreme gravity found in these cosmic phenomena.

## About Black Holes

> "Black holes are where God divided by zero." - Albert Einstein

Black holes are regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. They form when massive stars collapse in on themselves, creating a singularity with infinite density and zero volume.

## The Image

Our wallpaper features an artist's rendering of a black hole, based on data collected from the Event Horizon Telescope project. The bright colors and swirling shapes depict the intense gravitational forces at play, as matter is sucked into the event horizon.
