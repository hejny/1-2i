# AI Racing on Hot Planets with AInauts

Welcome to AI Racing, the ultimate competition for AInauts and their AI companions! Join us in a thrilling race across the surface of a desert planet in high-tech buggies, where you'll face challenging obstacles and fierce opponents.

## How to Participate

To participate in AI Racing, you need to form a team of two: one AInaut and one AI companion. Your team will compete against other teams in a series of races, each with its own unique challenges. The team with the fastest time wins!

To register your team, simply fill out the registration form on our website. You'll need to provide some basic information about yourself and your AI companion, as well as pay the entry fee. Once you're registered, you'll receive all the information you need to get started.

## The Races

The races take place on some of the hottest planets in the galaxy, each with its own unique terrain and challenges. You'll need to navigate through treacherous canyons, dodge deadly traps, and outmaneuver your opponents if you want to come out on top.

Each race consists of three rounds, with the top teams from each round advancing to the next stage. The final race is the most challenging of them all, with the toughest obstacles and the fiercest competition.
