## About Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is an emerging field of study that explores the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena to perform computational tasks. Unlike classical computers, which use bits to represent information, quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) to store and process data. This allows them to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers, making them a promising technology for a wide range of applications, from cryptography to drug discovery.
