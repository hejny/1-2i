# Binary Code Wallpaper

This website is dedicated to showcasing a unique wallpaper design featuring a repeating pattern of binary code. The wallpaper is designed with a simple font and black and white color scheme, making it perfect for anyone who wants a minimalist yet striking backdrop for their desktop or mobile device.

## What is Binary Code?

Binary code is a system of representing information using only two options: 0 and 1. It is the language that computers use to communicate and process data. Each digit in binary code is called a bit, and eight bits make up a byte. By combining bytes in different ways, computers can represent all kinds of information, from text and images to sound and video.

## The Design

The binary code wallpaper on this website features a repeating pattern of 8-bit bytes, arranged in a grid. The font used is a simple sans-serif style, which makes the code easy to read while still maintaining a clean, modern look. The black and white color scheme adds to the minimalist aesthetic of the design.
