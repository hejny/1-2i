## Installation Guide

Installing wallpaper can seem daunting, but it's actually quite simple. We've put together a step-by-step guide to help you install your wallpaper with ease. 

1. Prepare the wall by cleaning it and filling any holes or cracks.
2. Measure the wall and cut the wallpaper to size, leaving a few extra inches at the top and bottom.
3. Apply wallpaper paste to the back of the wallpaper and let it sit for a few minutes.
4. Starting from the top, apply the wallpaper to the wall, smoothing out any bubbles or wrinkles as you go.
5. Use a wallpaper brush to smooth out the wallpaper and trim any excess at the top and bottom.
