They belong to the family Laridae, which includes over 100 species of gulls, terns, and skimmers.\n\nThese birds are known for their distinctive calls, which can range from a high-pitched scream to a low, mournful wail. They are also known for their scavenging behavior, often seen swooping down to snatch food from unsuspecting beachgoers or scavenging garbage cans.\n\nDespite their sometimes pesky behavior, seagulls are fascinating creatures that have adapted well to life on both land and sea. They have excellent eyesight and can spot prey from great distances, and they are also strong fliers capable of traveling long distances without rest.\n\n## Download the Wallpaper\n\nIf you're a fan of seagulls or just appreciate the beauty of nature, we invite you to download our high-quality wallpaper and use it as your desktop background or mobile phone wallpaper.
