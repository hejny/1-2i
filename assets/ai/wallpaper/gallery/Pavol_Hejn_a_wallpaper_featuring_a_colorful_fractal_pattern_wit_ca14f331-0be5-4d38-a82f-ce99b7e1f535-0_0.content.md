## About Fractals

Fractals are complex mathematical patterns that repeat themselves at different scales. They are found in nature, from the branching of trees to the shape of clouds, and have been used in art and design for decades.

The beauty of fractals lies in their infinite complexity. Each time you zoom in on a fractal pattern, you discover new shapes and patterns that were not visible before.
