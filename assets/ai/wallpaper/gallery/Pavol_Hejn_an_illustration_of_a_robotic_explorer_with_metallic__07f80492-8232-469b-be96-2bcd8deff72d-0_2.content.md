### Mars Exploration Program

NASA's Mars Exploration Program is a long-term effort to explore the Red Planet. The program includes multiple robotic missions, such as the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover, which landed on Mars in February 2021. The rover's mission is to search for signs of ancient microbial life and collect rock samples that will eventually be returned to Earth.

### Rosetta Mission

The European Space Agency's Rosetta mission was launched in 2004 with the goal of studying Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The mission included a robotic lander, Philae, which successfully landed on the comet's surface in 2014. The data collected by the Rosetta mission has provided valuable insights into the formation of our solar system.

### Hayabusa2 Mission

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's Hayabusa2 mission was launched in 2014 with the goal of studying the asteroid Ryugu. The mission included multiple robotic landings on the asteroid's surface, as well as the collection of samples that were returned to Earth in December 2020. The data collected by the Hayabusa2 mission has provided valuable insights into the origins of our solar system.
