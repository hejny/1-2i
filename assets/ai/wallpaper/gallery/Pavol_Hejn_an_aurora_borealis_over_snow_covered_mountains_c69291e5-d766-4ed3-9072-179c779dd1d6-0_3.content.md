# Aurora Borealis Over Snow-Covered Mountains

Welcome to our website featuring a stunning wallpaper of an aurora borealis over snow-covered mountains. This breathtaking image captures the beauty and wonder of nature, showcasing the majesty of the northern lights against a backdrop of snowy peaks.

## About the Aurora Borealis

The aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights, is a natural phenomenon that occurs when charged particles from the sun collide with atoms in Earth's atmosphere. The resulting energy release creates a colorful display of light in the sky, ranging from green to pink to purple.

## The Beauty of Snow-Covered Mountains

Snow-covered mountains are a sight to behold, with their pristine white slopes and rugged peaks. These majestic landscapes are not only beautiful but also offer a range of outdoor activities, such as skiing, snowboarding, and hiking.
