## The Science Behind the Art

The concept of a space elevator may seem like science fiction, but it's based on real scientific principles. The idea is to use a cable anchored to the Earth's surface and extending into space, with a counterweight at the other end to keep the cable taut. Elevators would then travel up and down the cable, powered by electricity generated by solar panels on the cable itself.
