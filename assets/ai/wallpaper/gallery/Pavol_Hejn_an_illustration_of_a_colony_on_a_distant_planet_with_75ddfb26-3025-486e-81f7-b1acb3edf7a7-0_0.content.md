# Welcome to ColonyX

ColonyX is a website dedicated to exploring the possibilities of life on other planets. Our mission is to provide a platform for people who are interested in space exploration and colonization.

## About the Wallpaper

Our homepage features an illustration of a colony on a distant planet, with a mix of futuristic and traditional architecture. This image represents our vision of what a human settlement on another planet could look like. The buildings are designed to be self-sustaining, with advanced technology that allows them to generate their own energy and recycle resources.
