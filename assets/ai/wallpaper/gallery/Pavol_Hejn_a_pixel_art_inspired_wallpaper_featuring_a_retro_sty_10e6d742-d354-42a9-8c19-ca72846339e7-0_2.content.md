### Beginners Guide

Pixel art is a form of digital art that uses a limited color palette and pixelated lines to create images. It originated in the 1980s with the rise of video game consoles and has since become a popular art style in its own right.

To get started with pixel art, you'll need a program that allows you to create and edit pixel-based images. Some popular options include Aseprite, Pyxel Edit, and GraphicsGale.

Once you have a program, you can start creating your own pixel art by drawing one pixel at a time. It takes practice to master the technique, but with patience and dedication, you can create stunning works of art.

### History

Pixel art has a rich history that spans several decades. It first gained popularity in the 1980s with the rise of video game consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and the Sega Master System.

At the time, game developers had limited resources to work with, so they had to create graphics using a limited color palette and pixelated lines. This gave rise to the distinctive look of classic video games like Super Mario Bros. and Sonic the Hedgehog.

Today, pixel art continues to be popular among artists and gamers alike. Its nostalgic charm and unique aesthetic make it a beloved art style that will likely endure for years to come.
