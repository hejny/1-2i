Welcome to our website, where we embark on a journey through space and explore the unknown. Our team of Ainautes and their AI companions are always ready for an adventure, and they have discovered something truly remarkable - a massive, abandoned alien spacecraft floating in the depths of space.

## The Wallpaper

Our wallpaper depicts this incredible discovery, with our team of explorers standing in awe before the massive spacecraft. The intricate details of the ship's design are visible, and it is clear that this is no ordinary vessel. The wallpaper captures the sense of wonder and excitement that our team experiences as they explore the unknown.
