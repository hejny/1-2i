# Gas Giant Depths

Welcome to our website dedicated to exploring the depths of gas giants! Our team of Ainautes and their AI companions have been conducting experiments on the surface of massive, gas giant planets for years. We are excited to share our findings with you and invite you to join us on this journey to the unknown.

## Wallpaper

Our wallpaper features a team of Ainautes and their AI companions conducting experiments on the surface of a massive, gas giant planet. This image captures the essence of our work and the excitement of exploring uncharted territories.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to push the boundaries of space exploration and expand our understanding of the universe. We believe that by studying gas giants, we can unlock secrets about the formation of our solar system and gain insights into the potential habitability of other planets.
