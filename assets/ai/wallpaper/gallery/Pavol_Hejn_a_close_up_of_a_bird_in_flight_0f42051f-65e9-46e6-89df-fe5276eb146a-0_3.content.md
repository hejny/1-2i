## Installation Tips

Installing wallpaper can seem daunting, but with the right tools and techniques, it's a breeze. Here are some tips to help you get started:

1. Prepare the wall by cleaning it thoroughly and filling in any holes or cracks.
2. Measure the wall and cut the wallpaper to size, leaving a few extra inches at the top and bottom.
3. Apply wallpaper paste to the back of the paper, making sure to cover the edges.
4. Carefully place the paper on the wall, starting at the top and smoothing out any bubbles or wrinkles as you go.
5. Use a wallpaper brush to smooth out the paper and trim any excess from the top and bottom.
