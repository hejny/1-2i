# Math Minimalism

Welcome to Mathematically Minimalist, a website dedicated to exploring the intersection of mathematics and design. Our goal is to showcase how mathematical concepts can be used to create stunning visuals that are both aesthetically pleasing and intellectually stimulating.

## The Wallpaper

Our homepage features a wallpaper with a graph of complex mathematical equations, arranged in a minimalist and modern design. This wallpaper serves as a backdrop for our content, highlighting the beauty of mathematics and its applications in design.

## Our Content

At Mathematically Minimalist, we offer a variety of articles and resources that explore the use of mathematics in design. Here are some of the topics we cover:

-   **Fractals:** Learn about the beauty and complexity of fractals, and how they can be used to create stunning designs.
-   **Geometry:** Discover the power of geometric shapes and patterns, and how they can be used to create visually striking designs.
-   **Data Visualization:** Explore the world of data visualization, and learn how mathematical concepts can be used to turn complex data sets into beautiful visualizations.
-   **User Stories:** Read stories from designers who have used mathematical concepts in their work, and learn about the creative process behind their designs.

## References

We believe in sharing knowledge and resources with our community. Here are some of the references we recommend:

-   [Mathematics and Art](#): A Com<wbr>pre<wbr>hen<wbr>sive resource on the relationship between mathematics and art.
-   [The Beauty of Mathematics](#): A TED Talk by mathematician and artist, Ron Eglash, on the beauty of fractals in African art.
