- **Mantel Decor:** A well-styled mantel can really elevate your fireplace. Try incorporating candles, vases, or framed art to create a cohesive look.
- **Cozy Seating:** Arrange your furniture around the fireplace to create a cozy seating area. Add some plush pillows and blankets for extra comfort.
- **Seasonal Touches:** Switch up your decor throughout the year to keep things fresh. Add garlands, wreaths, or seasonal decor to your fireplace to reflect the current season or holiday.
