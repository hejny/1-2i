 *     -   **Entry params** are required to execute the prompt template pipeline.
 *     -   **Intermediate params** are used internally in the prompt template pipeline.
 *     -   **Result params** are not used internally in the prompt template pipeline, but are returned as the result of the prompt template pipeline execution.
