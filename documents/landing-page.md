# The AI web

The use of **generative AI** is going to be **HUGE**.

There is probably no creative industry that won't be **deeply affected**, and web design is no exception.

Designing a website with AI can be quite challenging. You may find yourself asking questions like:

-   Which tool should I use?
-   What version of that tool?
-   How should I prompt it?
-   What upscale should I use?
-   Does the page look good on all devices?
-   Picking the right <span style="color: #ff0000">c</span><span style="color: #ff6622">o</span><span style="color: #ffff00">l</span><span style="color: #55cc66">o</span><span style="color: #9999ff">r</span><span style="color: #9955ff">s</span> and <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif">fonts</span>

We have great tools such as [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/), [Dalle-2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2), as well as many models for [Stable diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/). However, **these are not web generators**; they are great building blocks that require balancing, tweaking, and a considerable amount of expertise and time.

So we created the **easiest way to design** your own **web using AI**.

### Sounds incredible?!

You are now on such a website - the page you are on is an example of a fully AI-designed website.

### Want yours?

You don't need to be an experienced prompt engineer or even think about AI tools at all. Just go through the gallery of ready-made webs and if you ‚ô•Ô∏è one you can claim one, its just that easy:

 <iframe
    src="https://ai.hejny.org/"
    allowtransparency="true"
    scrolling="no"
    style="
        /* width: 100vw; */
        height: 500vh;
        margin-left:0;
        /* border: 1px dotted red */
    "
></iframe>

---

Then you can:

1. Just take that **web** and have it **live in 5 minutes**
2. Export the template for your system like WordPress, Webflow, Wix, Nette or take it as a first prototype for webdesigner
3. Take the prompts and a starting point and make super fitting AI web just by yourself but with huge initial help of first kickoff
