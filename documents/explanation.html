<h1>The AI web.</h1>
<p>
    There is probably no creative industry that won't be deeply affected by generative AI. The web design is no
    exception. But designing a website with AI can be quite challenging. You may find yourself asking many questions
    like:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Which <b>tool</b> should I use?</li>
    <li>What <b>version</b> of that tool?</li>
    <li>How should I <b>prompt</b> it?</li>
    <li>What <b>upscale</b> should I use?</li>
    <li>Does the page look good on all <b>devices</b>?</li>
    <li>
        Picking the right

            ><span style="color: #ffff00">l</span><span style="color: #55cc66">o</span
            ><span style="color: #9999ff">r</span><span style="color: #9955ff">s</span></b

        and
        <img
            src="assets/fonts.svg"
            alt="fonts"
            style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 1em; transform: scale(1.8) translatex(6px)"
        />
    </li>

    We have great tools such as <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a>,
    <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/">MidJourney</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2">Dalle-2</a>, as well as
    many models for <a href="https://stablediffusionweb.com/">Stable diffusion</a>. However,
    <b>these are not web generators</b>; they are great building blocks that require balancing, tweaking, and a
    considerable amount of expertise and time.

        prototype for webdesigner
    </li>
    <li>
